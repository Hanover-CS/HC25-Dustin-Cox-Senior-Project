#My project ideas


## Idea 1 original game
Create my own dungeon crawler game. come up with my own game, create a story, characters, and a main objective to complete. Sort of a miny adventure game or some similar premise. Will have a start screen with settings and some accessability options. A save system to save the progress of the player, as well as a option for different saves for different playthorugh with different classes. However not level progress, only player stats and what the player has achieved on their runs, There will be 7 different stages with unique enimies with chests with potential food, and player buffs. Combat- the enemies will have fixed attack patterns that the player avoids or will attempt to create a mini ai to control the enemies to move in certaint ways and use attacks in different patterns.


## Idea 2 Sleep App- app to help moniter and track my sleep patterns
Will need some sort of input method to moniter sleep, a sensor or audio intake Will need to be able to measure heart rate, if i snore or when i toss and turn.


## Idea 3 ai and how its usefull
Ai in computer programming - Saw some adds about ai and how it can e used in computer science/codiing. Like how much can ai do in regards to coding? how viable is it in creating good, readable code? Will it become strong enough to filter out certain CS and coding jobs, could it replace entire teams of coders in specific areas? ----- Reason for idea watched a youtuber who experimented on the idea and had a few friends code and create different application, like a sorting game, a website, etc. Then he asked ai to do the same and i found the results interesting.
