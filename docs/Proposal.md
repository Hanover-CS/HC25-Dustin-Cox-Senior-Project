## Top down Rougue lite Dungeon Crawler Game



## Description
My game will be a top down game where the camera will follow above the player character, It will be a dungeon crawler. The game with have accesibility option to change brightness, audio and music volumes. The main game features are that you one life per dungeon dive, if you die there are no revies, ,you are sent back to the starting area to begin a new run. There are no permanant player upgrades, only permanent upgrades are for the weapons,using special material from fighting and defeating the final boss on floor 7. There will be no other player progression other than that.


## The Menu and Beggining
-The game will have a start menu where the player will have settings option to change the volume of the music and ingame sounds. There will be no brightness setting as I want to maintain a certain feel for each level. I may even dabble in having a language option to change the language to say Spanish or Portugese.

-The Starting area is the hub, It is where you will launch your dive and where you will return upon your inevitible demise. It will house the main hub for where you can see all the upgrade trinkets you have found on your runs thus far, display any lore you may have found, an display how many levels of the dungeon you have discovered. There will also be an area where once the player gets the required material will be able to choose an upgrade for the weapon of their choice. There is also the Base XP in the game. This isnt for player upgrades but to increase lets say hest spawns, Keeper prices have a 5% discount. Stuff like that. 

## Fighting/healing/currency: 
-Fighting: live combat, Not turn based. The enimies will move around and their attacts will vary by their type. Zombies rely on close combat, slimes a mix of both close and ranged with different attacks in correspondance to their type(fire, stone). There will be hostile plants and the good-ole classic mimic. The player will only have acces to a sword and dagger. The sword for melee and the dagger for ranged. This will be the only option until you defeat the final boss once and unlock the crossbow and shortsword. The crossbow is for range and the shortsword for melee. There will also be throw-ables such as poison cloud bombs and player invulnerbility for a few seconds.

-Healing/Buffs: There will be found items that will provide buffs for the current run, these buff could include getting coinds after clearing an area, increase to movement speed, or even enlarging your sword for extra damage. You will use found or purchased food for healing(varying restoration depending on the food). Potatoes, Apples, carrots, Steak, and chocolate are what will be primarily found. Chocolate being the rarest. There will be an obsurdly rare food item that I'll Keep Secret for now.

-Currency: Gold coins and keys will be forms of currency. The gold is for exchanging for items from the shopkeeper that can be found once per level. The Keeper as he is called will offer three items at random. The can be either food or player buffs, or throw-ables. Inside every Keeper room will be a roulete box where the player can exchange coins or keys for guranteed items such as keys and coins respectively, or even extra hearts. The keys are also for opening locked doors and chests. However, they keys may not always work on the first try, so use them well.

## Level Design and Style
-Level Generation: The levels will have the same color pallet and basic structure throughout but the levels and the scattered things to find will be procedural. No two levels would ever look the same. For example Level one is the highest floor, closest to the surface. Nture as been able to kreep into the darkness to reclaim its territory. Hostile plants will be scattered throughout shooting poisons and manipulating the poor souls that delved into the dungeon before you. So the level will have an overgrown feel. The levels designs and colors will reflect the deeper the floor.

-Room Generation: Since the floors will be procedural I plan to have room and halways templets to use to randomly create the level. Crates, vases, and chests can spawn almost everywhere in each level. Althought the floors will have different furniture and props.


## Workspace and toolkits
-I will be primarily working in the github codespace as i am more comfortable working there. I plan to uses the Phaser toolkit as well as other usefull libraries such as Rot.js which is specifically designed for developing roguelike games in the browser. Useful for procedural generation.
Tiled Map Editor tool for 2D tilemaps and epxoting them to phaser.
Aseprite or Piskel, Pixel art tools for creating and animating 2d Sprites, Good for charater and enemy design.
Freesound.org: Large database of free sound effects.
OpenGameArt.org: source of free music, sound effects, and art.
Howler.js: JavaScript libray that integrates well with phaser for controlling sound effects and background music.

**I may not use all of these** Simply here for reference and availabilty if needed.
