## Ancient Dungeon
https://store.steampowered.com/app/1125240/Ancient_Dungeon/  
A vr title that im taking main inspiration from with its gameplay and world building.
this is to the official steam page, one of the two websites that the indie dev has the title available for purchase.
 \It is the game whose style is what is the min inspiration for my game, however i cant make a vr game like how this one is. The main mechanics I'm going for that this game is the system it has for progression. It has 5 floors with their own uniqe sets of monsters and each level has a unique color scheme. Each level you can find lore, coins, keys, and relics that give your player buffs for the duration of the run. There is also a shop located on each floor randomly. When the player dies they are sent back to the starting area and all coins, keys, and powerups are removed. There is a sort of collectibles menu that displayes all the lore and relics the player has found and which levels the player has discovered so far. This game has two weapons sets, a sword and dagger and a crosbow and short sword. However the crosbow and short sword is only unlocked after completing all 5 floors killing the final boss on floor 5. Also each time you kill the final boss you recieve a special currency that is used to permantely upgrade one of the weapons sets of your choosing. ost of these mechanics i want in my game. Since this is a vr title I am limited in the scope of how i can translate certain aspects. I really like these gameplay mechanics and its voxel structure. I fell like this will translate well to a sidescroll or top down game.

website of the dev of the vr title - the primary source where the dev describes hiself, the tiles he has made and where you can buy and play them.

link to the official steam page. This is another existing rouge-lite game that has elements i want to incorporate into my game. 
The game is very similar to ancient dungeon but it isnt a side-scroll or top down. It has a fixed camera angle behind the player. The gameplay is similar in that you progrees through the level killing enemies- it also has a shop mid level to buy upgrades and potions. However it seams the weopons and other things you find stay with you indefinietly which isnt what im aimiing for. The camera angle, sprites and animations are what im looking at mainly, im going to use these as inspiration and reference when i go to create my sprites and polish their movements. the aspect for the sprites that got my attention is the fact that both stationary and moving sprites rotate to match the camera angle and which way you are facing. However, the dev of this game has seemed to have abandonded the game as it is no longer for purchase and has been in early access since 2019.

gives me siilar vibes of the different stages with pre set enimies to fight, took note of how its only a side profile view and minimal sprite animation except for the card effects.
